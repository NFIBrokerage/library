# Elixir Library Template

Our (`@NFIBrokerage`'s) standard template for new Elixir libraries.

This template is written as a
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
For another example of a cookiecutter template repository, see:
[spotify/cookiecutter-golang](https://github.com/spotify/cookiecutter-golang).

Why use cookiecutter when Elixir already has cool stuff like EEx and
[mix_templates](https://github.com/pragdave/mix_templates)? We generate new
services and libraries using [Backstage](https://backstage.io) and the default
templater for backstage is cookiecutter.
